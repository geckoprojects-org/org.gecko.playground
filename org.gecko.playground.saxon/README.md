# `org.gecko.playground.saxon`

This project shows how to OSGify Saxon as well known framework.

**Note:** This project also needs *org.gecko.playground.xmlresolver* to be OSGified.

This is done using a project template in *bndtools* for OSGify JAR's. It can be used a recipe.



This bundle is also used in the *org.gecko.playground.xslt* project, to show it is working.
