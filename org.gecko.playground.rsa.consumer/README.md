# `org.gecko.playground.rsa.consumer`

This project is a consumer example for our remote service.

It just contains the *Example* component, that gets wants the *HelloWorld* service, provided by the API.

So as soon as the service discovery recognizes this service, it creates a local proxy for the *HelloWorld* service and injects it.
